Repository including bug reports for Europcar mobile app
I created three bug reports for Europcar mobile app. The first bug report is about "Sign up error". 
The second bug report is about "Problem with the database". The last bug report is about "Failure of the localization feature". 
Each bug report is in the template. Bug reports were created in 2021.
Bug templates are from one of the crowdtesting companies. 
Bug reports were approved by the leader of the project.
